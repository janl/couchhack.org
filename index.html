      <h2>What's Up?</h2>

      <p>CouchHack 2013 is an <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org">Apache
      CouchDB</a> developer-focused relaxing and intimate four-day hack
      event in Vienna, Austria. We'll be here advancing the state of the
      world's best replicating database, and we'd love you to contribute
      too! All skills welcome, from javascripters and documentation, through
      erlangists and packagers. Enthusiasm is not optional!</p>

      <h2>Where Its At</h2>

      <p>On the weekend of 13 to 16 December, we are inviting all CouchDB
      hackers, and those who want to be one to CouchHack Vienna. Or even
      those who just want to learn a little about CouchDB. Heck, you can
      come if you would like to chill out with passionate tech people.</p>

      <p>Vienna is located in Central Europe, and has been a social,
      political, and cultural hub long before North Americans started
      building railways. So you might even want to come by a couple of days
      early and check it out!</p>

      <h2>Be a Part of History</h2>

      <p>Previous CouchHacks have been run in Europe and North America
      in:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Berlin, Germany</li>

        <li>Asheville, North Carolina</li>

        <li>Oakland, California</li>

        <li>Vienna, Austria</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Gimme the Details</h2>

      <p>We start at 10am, at <a
      href="http://www.sektor5.at/about/contact/">sektor5</a> A larger map
      is <a
      href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=sektor5+coworking+spaces+Wien,+Siebenbrunnengasse,+Wien,+%C3%96sterreich&amp;aq=1&amp;oq=sektor5&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=51.974572,114.169922&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=sektor5+coworking+spaces&amp;hnear=Siebenbrunnengasse,+1050+Wien,+Austria&amp;t=m&amp;ll=48.186076,16.355123&amp;spn=0.006295,0.006295&amp;output=embed">here</a>.</p>

      <p>The closest Public transport stops are at:</p> <pre>
Metro: U4 Pilgramgasse Bus:14A Arbeitergasse Bus: 59A
Reinprechtsdorferstrasse </pre>

      <p>A very convenient option is to go via tram or train to
      Matzleinsdorfer Platz and then walk straight "downhill" towards
      Siebenbr&#252;nnnengasse.</p>

      <p>For finding how to get from A to B, use the excellent smartphone
      app "AnachB" which is German for A to B. It's really good, and has an
      android and ios version. They have a webpage which isn't as nice, <a
      href="http://anachb.at">anachb.at</a></p>

      <p>But far the best transport is <a
      href="http://www.citybikewien.at/">CityBike</a> with a <a
      href="http://goo.gl/maps/LnxG">drop-off point</a> just 2 minutes away
      in Siebenbr&#252;nnen Platz.</p>

      <p>Planning &amp; Updates will be on <a
      href="http://lanyrd.com/crqzt">Lanryd</a>.</p>

      <h2>How do I get to Vienna, or get around in Vienna?</h2>

      <p>Vienna has awesome public transport, and a free** city bike system.
      Consider either getting day passes for the Metro (all buses, trains,
      underground and trams) or using the excellent bike network.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Getting to Vienna, from the airport is easy - <a
        href="http://www.wien.info/en/travel-info/to-and-around/airport-to-center">either
        with the CAT express or the S-bahn for half the price.</a></li>

        <li>Using public transport - either website or install the iPhone
        app <a
        href="http://www.anachb.at/?set_language=en&amp;cl=en">AnachB.at</a></li>

        <li>Using the free <a
        href="http://www.citybikewien.at/">CityBike</a> system, book online
        or pay upfront. Pick a bike up anywhere, use it for an hour, and
        drop it back at almost any Metro stop or hundreds of other
        convenient locations. Note the conviently small toggle for English
        in the top left hand corner!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>After I've had enough CouchDB, what should I see in Vienna?</h2>

      <p>Almost everything you can imagine can be found in Vienna, and most
      of it conveniently accessible with train/tram or citybike. So where to
      start?</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The <a
        href="http://www.wien.info/en/shopping-wining-dining/markets/naschmarkt">Naschmarkt</a>
        for food from around the world, a large outdoor market.</li>

        <li>Nearby <a
        href="http://www.wienmuseum.at/index.php?id=124">Karlsplatz</a> has
        a fantastic modern museum, a stunning church, and takes you in
        through to the old city centre.</li>

        <li>The <a
        href="http://www.mqw.at/?kat_id=196&amp;page_id=758&amp;lang=2">Museum
        Quarter</a> is self explanatory but stunning in both architecture
        and the sheer number and variety of museums. It's the Mall of
        Museums!</li>

        <li>Vienna is overflowing with parks and gardens, the Botanic and
        Schweitzer Gardens near the Belvedere Palace, or the almost 40km
        square Prater park across the river.</li>

        <li>Palaces - Belvedere, Sch&#195;&#182;nbrunn, the Parliament
        Buildings and MOAR! - <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Palaces_in_Vienna">LMGTFY?</a>
        Approximately 57 to choose from.</li>
      </ul>
